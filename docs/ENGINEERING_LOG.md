# Engineering Continuity Log

This file is the durable session handoff required by `docs/MASTER_ENGINEERING_PROMPT.md`. It records repository facts and evidence, not an assertion that the full project is accepted.

## 2026-10-31 — resumed engineering execution

### Source of instructions and baseline

- Operating protocol: [`docs/MASTER_ENGINEERING_PROMPT.md`](MASTER_ENGINEERING_PROMPT.md), read from branch `docs/master-engineering-continuity-prompt`, blob `f9b67598a3cec5efb5d63ecd7cb5496732576478`.
- Repository: `cognitive-kernel/Personal-AI-assistant`.
- `main` after the changes in this checkpoint: `6f601e8cc210419392bfbd1affb9590db978dd3a`.
- Previous application-code baseline: `a23760805310154d83e47489eddf00fc9b91c7f6`.
- No production database, local user data, or target-host state was accessed or modified.

### Completed work

| Task | Root cause / purpose | Result | Exact evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering status synchronization (PR #664) | Five status/acceptance documents lagged behind PR #666 and the verified CI baseline. | Merged documentation-only update. | Merge `48aafa2a2859c74c8fe3473b8f2f1e6dfe474dfe`; exact PR head `19a95d93702d6281bdf6ae065a309a9b133de746`. |
| Durable automatic lesson follow-up (PR #667) | `_continue_lessons` kept later approved topics in process memory and persisted each run only immediately before browser work. A provider error or process interruption could leave later topics without durable queue records. | Automatic follow-up now persists all eligible approved topics as independent FIFO runs before browser capture, then relies on the existing dispatcher/lease/retry/recovery path. Added a regression proving the whole batch is queued before provider work can start. No schema migration. | Merge `6f601e8cc210419392bfbd1affb9590db978dd3a`; exact PR head `810fe450668ff6c3e0e5b74c286533abb32dfb55`. |

  - Actions: [tests](https://github.com/cognitive-kernel/Personal-AI-assistant/actions/runs/41211765586), [browser E2E](https://github.com/cognitive-kernel/Personal-AI-assistant/actions/runs/41211765242), [dependency audit](https://github.com/cognitive-kernel/Personal-AI-assistant/actions/runs/41211765399).
- Post-merge workflows for `48aafa2a2859c74c8fe3473b8f2f1e6dfe474dfe` and `6f601e8cc210419392bfbd1affb9590db978dd3a` were still running at the time this entry was written. Do not mark post-merge CI complete until exact-SHA runs finish successfully.

### Acceptance gates still open

- Issue [#290](https://github.com/cognitive-kernel/Personal-AI-assistant/issues/290) remains open.
- Issue [#52](https://github.com/cognitive-kernel/Personal-AI-assistant/issues/52): independent security review of the Ollama loopback boundary is still required; implementation tests are not a substitute.
- Target-Windows-host baseline, load/soak, crash recovery, staging restore and rollback rehearsal remain unverified here.
- Live Persian/English model evaluation and human adjudication remain open. Deterministic/lexical CI benchmarks do not prove semantic correctness.
- Manual keyboard-only, screen-reader and rendered-state accessibility review remain open.
- Owner-reported legacy database migration completion remains owner-reported until independent target-host evidence is attached.

### Progress accounting

No completion percentage is published in this checkpoint. The existing acceptance ledger does not yet define a validated weighted scoring rubric across all gates. A reproducible weighted scorecard must be established from the live acceptance criteria before percentages are reported. This avoids converting code presence or green CI into a misleading project-completion claim.

### Next actions

1. Verify exact-SHA post-merge tests, browser E2E and dependency audit for both merge commits above.
2. Build a weighted acceptance scorecard from Issue #290 and `docs/ROADMAP_ACCEPTANCE.md`, with separate engineering and overall-acceptance denominators; do not count human/target-host gates as repository engineering work.
3. Reconcile the large set of historical branches against merged/closed PRs; preserve branches with unmerged useful work until their disposition is established.
4. Continue the highest-risk uncompleted repository workstream from the live ledger, adding a regression for every reproduced defect.
5. Keep all human-only and independent-review gates open until evidence is supplied by the responsible reviewer/operator.
